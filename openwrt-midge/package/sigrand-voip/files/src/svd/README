README for telsip
=====================

What is it?
-----------

Telsip is a simple sip client which is developed by teleton company for
DECT-VoIP router.

How I can build it and install?
-------------------------------

Run 

./configure --host=mipsel-linux-uclibc --build=i686-linux-gnu

I'd assume that pkg-config is able to find the sofia-sip-ua library
compiled for mips. 

After that you can copy create executable to the ramdisk, upload
it and use in target linux system.

Where can I get additional information?
---------------------------------------

Look in the doc subdir.
