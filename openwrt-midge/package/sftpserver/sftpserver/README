Green End SFTP Server
=====================

  This is an SFTP server supporting up to protocol version 6.  It is
  possible to use it as a drop-in replacement for the OpenSSH server.

Requirements
------------

  This software runs under Linux, Mac OS X and FreeBSD.  It may work
  on other UNIX platforms.

Installation
------------

  The general procedure is:

     ./configure
     make             # builds software and runs tests
     make install     # probably as root

  See INSTALL for generic instructions.  Local configure options include:
     --enable-reversed-symlink
       Some (but annoyingly not all) SFTP clients get the arguments to
       the symlink operation the wrong way round.  This option
       reverses the server's interpretation of the arguments so that
       such clients can be made to work (while breaking correctly
       written clients).
     --enable-warnings-as-errors
       Enable treatment of warnings-as-errors.  Developers should use
       this but end users probably don't care.

  You will need iconv and readline libraries.

  It's best to run 'make check' before installing, but this requires
  Python (see http://www.python.org/) and the Paramiko SSH module
  (see http://www.lag.net/paramiko/) to be installed.

Status
------

  This server is currently experimental and still under development.
  Don't trust your critical data to it.  The code has an extensive and
  growing test suite (invoke 'make check' to run it) but bugs may yet
  remain.

  The code is written to be secure against malicious clients but not
  currently tested against malicious clients.  In the typical usage
  pattern for an SFTP server this is academic: why bother exploiting a
  SFTP server bug when you can log in as the same user?

  However it is also possible to arrange for the SFTP server to run on
  a security boundary, for instance listening directly on a TCP port
  or running under a login that is only allowed to run the SFTP
  server.

  Until such time as the test suite is expanded to include actively
  hostile clients, it is not recommended that this server be used in
  such configurations without some additional form of protection
  against malicious use.
