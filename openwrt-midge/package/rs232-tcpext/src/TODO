       TCP_KEEPCNT
              The  maximum  number  of keepalive probes TCP should send before
              dropping the connection.

       TCP_KEEPINTVL
              The time (in seconds) between individual keepalive probes.

       TCP_KEEPIDLE
              The time (in seconds) the connection needs to remain idle before
              TCP starts  sending  keepalive  probes,  if  the  socket  option
              SO_KEEPALIVE  has  been  set on this socket.

       TCP_NODELAY
              If set, disable the Nagle algorithm.  This means  that  segments
              are  always  sent  as  soon as possible, even if there is only a
              small amount of data.  When not  set,  data  is  buffered  until
              there  is  a sufficient amount to send out, thereby avoiding the
              frequent sending of small packets, which results  in  poor  uti-
              lization of the network.  This option is overridden by TCP_CORK;
              however, setting this option forces an explicit flush of pending
              output, even if TCP_CORK is currently set.
