	  thttpd is a simple, small, portable, fast, and secure HTTP server.
		Simple:
			It handles only the minimum necessary to implement HTTP/1.1. Well, maybe a little more than the minimum. 
		Small:
			See the comparison chart. It also has a very small run-time size, since it does not fork and is very careful about memory allocation. 
		Portable:
			It compiles cleanly on most any Unix-like OS, specifically including FreeBSD, SunOS 4, Solaris 2, BSD/OS, Linux, OSF. 
		Fast:
			In typical use it's about as fast as the best full-featured servers (Apache, NCSA, Netscape). Under extreme load it's much faster. 
		Secure:
			It goes to great lengths to protect the web server machine against attacks and breakins from other sites.
