	  Viewer can be behind Nat router or directly connected to the internet

	  Instead of forwarding serveral ports, you only need to forward 1 port

	  If the PC that runs the Repeater has access to the local DNS server, 
	  you can use your local DNS names instead of 10.10.10.12.

	  This could be handy when you have a dynamic DHCP server allocating 
	  ip adresses for your PC.
