	  GNU Midnight Commander is a text-mode full-screen file manager. 
	  It uses a two panel interface and a subshell for command execution. 
	  It includes an internal editor with syntax highlighting and an 
	  internal viewer with support for binary files. Also included is 
	  Virtual Filesystem (VFS), that allows files on remote systems 
	  (e.g. FTP, SSH, SMB servers) and files inside archives to be 
	  manipulated like real files.
