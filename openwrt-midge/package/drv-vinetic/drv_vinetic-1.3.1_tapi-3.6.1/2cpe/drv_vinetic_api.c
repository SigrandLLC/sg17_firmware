\remarks
      Every access to the VINETIC has to be done via this module.
      Most functions are protected against reentrants and interrupts.
      Since functions ScRead and ScWrite can not be used in interrupt level
      macros for access are provided called SC_READ and SC_WRITE. They have to
      be used with care, manual protection from interrupts must be done!
      They should be used only in this and in the interrupt module.

\remarks
   Some firmware commands aren't directly read via CmdRead.
   Instead, a read command is written when the interrupt event occurs, and
   later on, when COBX event occurs, it is checked whether the read command is
   the one awaited, and if yes, the command is stored in the device or channel
   structure for a later use.
   Two applications of this are:
      - Coder Switching AAL (on SRE2 [DEC_CHG])
      - RTCP statistics
   Every time a command is requested from interrupt context without waitin on
   it, in pDev->nMbxState DS_CMDREQ is set. DS_RDCMD_SENT indicates that
   CmdRead itself requested data.
   After reading and dispatching the data, the flag DS_CMDREQ  will be cleared
   and depending on a DS_RDCMD_SENT the flag DS_CMDREAD is set, to indicate
   that probably the requested data is available in the device mailbox
