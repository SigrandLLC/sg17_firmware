CHG Default GR909 limits are programmed at measurement start if no previous
    configuration done.
CHG GR909 RIT Measurements are always done with a ringing frequency of 20 Hz
    for xCPE. The limits values must be calculated accordingly.
CHG Resistive faults and Receiver Offhook measurements are always triggered
    together if one of the measurement is selected. This is done so because the
    DC Firmware can't handle these measurement separately at the moment.

    The silence compression status may not be changed if a G.729 coder
    is already running. In that case the driver returns an error.
NEW for VINETIC-2CPE V2.1, UTG. Supports up to 8 UTG resources (according
    to the used FW). This allows to play out different tones in multiple
    directions simultaneously. Tone Resources could be stopped with index #0,
    sensitive to the configured direction.
NEW for VINETIC-2CPE V2.1, NLEC/WLEC. Supports WLEC (according to the used
    FW). In case of WLEC, a fixed and mowing window (each with a size of 8ms)
    will be configured. The mowing window is adaptive and will be controlled
    by the EDSP-FW.
CHG When calling enable fax services now no action according the coder and LEC
    are done.
    Before starting usage of T.38 services, it must be ensured that encoding,
    decoding and LEC are disabled (using respectively IFX_TAPI_ENC_STOP,
    IFX_TAPI_DEC_STOP and IFX_TAPI_LEC_PHONE_CFG_SET). It is also recommended
    deactivation of fax/modem signal detectors
    (using IFX_TAPI_SIG_DETECT_DISABLE), optionally tone holding detection
    might be enabled in order to detect end of fax fransmission
CHG Flash hook minimum time may now be smaller than the pulse digit low
    maximum time. In the case of an overlap time a flash hook and a digit 1 is
    reported. No flash hooks are reported for other digits
CHG Configure minimum signal level detection of CED, DIS and TONEHOLDING tone
    individually.
CHG Change in the implementation how to use the PCM interface. Previous
    implementation only used every second available PCM channel of VINETIC-1.x.
    Now all PCM channels can be used in 8-Bit mode. Half can be used in 16-Bit
    mode. The lower half of the TAPI channel is using every second
    PCM firmware channel (0,2,4,6,...).
    The upper half of TAPI channel is using the other PCM channel (1,3,5,7,...).
    swapped. Default is now TAPI_RTPEV_ONLY (previously TAPI_RTPEV_ALL)
CHG changed CID structure field private to priv in IFX_TAPI_CID_ABS_REASON_t
    because private is reserved in C++
FIX For VINETIC-S V2.1 no GPIO actions were done
FIX Contrary status information for T.38 removed: TX_ON and TX_OFF and
    DP_ON and DP_OFF was sometimes set at the same time.
FIX The ioctl's IFXPHONE_PCM_ADD and IFXPHONE_PCM_REMOVE implemented for Linux

FIX Event settings in RTP Conf for TAPI_RTPEV_ALL and TAPI_RTPEV_EVONLY was
    swapped. Default is now TAPI_RTPEV_ONLY (previously TAPI_RTPEV_ALL)

    values introduced TAPI_VAD_SC_ONLY and TAPI_VAD_CNG_ONLY.
    The silence compression status may not be changed if a G.729 coder
    is already running. In that case the driver returns an error.
CHG IFXPHONE_METER_START now accepts burst_dist = 0 if burst_cnt is 1
CHG Flash hook minimum time may now be smaller than the pulse digit low
    maximum time. In the case of an overlap time a flash hook and a digit 1 is
    reported. No flash hooks are reported for other digits
FIX Event settings in RTP Conf for TAPI_RTPEV_ALL and TAPI_RTPEV_EVONLY was

version 1.0.13, 2005-08-01
----------------------------
CHG Updated embedded controller download to V3.13.05 for VINETIC -4M/C
    Version 2.2 and V4.04.12 for VINETIC -S Version 2.1

version 1.0.12, 2005-07-29
----------------------------
FIX Event report for RFC2833 event packets from network did not work correctly.

version 1.0.11, 2005-07-27
----------------------------
CHG PHONE_DTMF_OOB now makes no check on the used coder
CHG The driver supports to differentiate the between interrupt line and global
   interrupts. If the driver is not set to polling mode and no interrupt line
   is configured, the global interrupt is locked instead. Interrupts are
   unlocked when the critical software part is done.
CHG Change the parameter of the structure 'TAPI_PHONE_AGC' to lower-case.
FIX DTMF event were not reported for TAPI channel 5 and 6 of one VINETIC device.
FIX The TAPI event 'TAPI_SIGNAL_CIDENDTX' was reported to early for FSK
   transmission mode. Now the event is reported when the CID transmission is
   completed for DTMF and FSK.

version 1.0.10, 2005-07-15
----------------------------
CHG Compile for VINETIC S improved
FIX Test access defines missing

    IFXPHONE_JB_CONF.  Bits PJE and DVF were reset.
FIX While handling IFXPHONE_INIT, tapi driver configures CID transmitter to
    send CID to both Adder-1 and Adder-2 (SIGNL_baseConf). It is now by default
    configured to be sent to ALM only.
CHG CPT detection implemention changed to new tone api.
FIX Inconsitency of signal connection on multiple tapi initializations fixed

version 1.0.8, 2005-07-01
----------------------------
NEW Add the 'TAPI_PHONE_STATUS.signal' event 'TAPI_SIGNAL_CIDENDTX' to
    indicate that the Caller-ID is transmitted successfully. For DTMF, the
    event is generated when the transmission is complete. For FSK, the event
    is generated when the last bytes are written to the VINETIC.
    Note: Here the end of transmission comes delayed after the event occurs.
NEW Add the 'TAPI_PHONE_STATUS.line' event 'TAPI_LINESTATUS_RINGFINISHED' to
    indicate that the initial ringing hat ended. This event is used in order
    to synchronize the CID1 scenario on application level.
NEW Add the 'TAPI_PHONE_STATUS.error' flag to signalize runtime errors to host.
    Error events are defined in TAPI_ERROR enumeration.
FIX Add a workaround with new driver API in order to change the different line
    modes. The VINETIC 2.1 does not recognize the automodes correctly.
    The linemodes 'TAPI_LINEFEED_NORMAL_LOW' and 'TAPI_LINEFEED_REVERSED_LOW'
    are added to change to short line manually.
    The new event 'TAPI_LINESTATUS_FEEDLOWBATT' indicates that the change to
    low feeding has to be done manually.
FIX CID Appearance check is done accordingly in the scenario
    <initial ringing> <periodical ringing with cid tx>
FIX Runtime error TAPI_ERROR_RINGCADENCE_CIDTX is set in TAPI_PHONE_STATUS.error
    and asserted in case the ring pause time is not enough.

version 1.0.7, 2005-06-30

CHG Old stuff for Hook recognition and Pulse dialing removed.
FIX new module connection implementation now also supports local and external
    conferencing
CHG PHONE_VAD now does not return an error if activated with G.729E.
FIX in PHONE_VAD: Always apply the VAD setting not matter which coder is used
FIX Wake up application on blocking ring after off hook. Previously the
    application had to wait till the max rings has expired no matter if off
    hook appeared or not.
FIX Requesting the RTCP statistics of the device by usind
    'TAPI_LL_Phone_RTCP_PrepareStatistics' and
    'TAPI_LL_Phone_RTCP_GatherStatistics' in the interrupt context fixed.
    Driver wrote to long message to the mailbox in order to request an update.
CHG The PHI programs for 8 bit and for V1.3 are now internally selected by
    the driver according to the configured access mode
CHG DTMF Generator was configured that tones will be generated in transmit
    and receive direction after a DTMF event occures. Tones are now only
    generated in recieve direction (adder-2, to the subscriber)
CHG On the IFXPHONE_RTCP_STATISTICS command the field ssrc gets now the value
    which was configured previously by IFXPHONE_RTP_CONF (stored in driver)
CHG Dail and Packet FIFO allocation and freeing modified
CHG IFXPHONE_TONE_TABLE_CONF now applies to the driver no longer to devices
    (global table)
CHG Play on UTG and TG at the same time now possible. Minimal resource
    management implemented. The tone play and stop service must specify
    which resource to be used: TAPI_TONE_SRC_TG or TAPI_TONE_SRC_DSP.
    Default uses DSP on VIP/M/C and TG on S.
FIX When invalid chip information received, the driver returned no error
    on init.
FIX TAPI_NONE as mode for IFXPHONE_INIT does not call Basic_xConf()
CHG RUNTIME_TRACE available without EVALUATION
FIX IrqPollMode is initialized/reset correctly if no IRQ is configured
NEW Added IFXPHONE_TONE_PLAY_NET for data fds. The playout of tones
    simultaneously on different sources (TG and UTG) is not supported.
    Also the playout of local and network tones at the same time is not
    supported. Composed tones are not supported for source TG.
FIX add parameter check for IFXPHONE_x_ADD / IFXPHONE_x_REMOVE
FIX in the driver feature IFXPHONE_SET_PCM_CONFIG / IFXPHONE_SET_PCM_ACTIVATION
    (Deactivation and higher Timeslots were not working properly)
NEW Added LEC resource management to the driver. It shares the available LEC
    resources between the ALM-Modules and the PCM-Modules.
    The resource management is used by the driver feature
    IFXPHONE_LECCONF / IFXPHONE_LECCONF_PCM

version 1.0.5.0, 2005-05-03

CHG Firmware message handling (incl. ASYNC_CMD) improved
NEW IFXPHONE_HIGH_LEVEL added to support output signals with level higher
    than 3.14 dBm
NEW Implemented RFC 2833 firmware feature with ETU (event transmission unit).
    The driver now reports events that are played out masked be eventDetect bit
    in the exception bit structure. Event transmission of ATD and UTD features
    is also supported
NEW Interface to enable/change LEC settings for PCM interface
    (IFXPHONE_LECCONF_PCM/IFXPHONE_GETLECCONF_PCM). This feature includes
    setting of the correct default coefficients.
CHG The meaning of nGainRx and nGainTx in TAPI_PHONE_VOLUME changes.
    Instead of having 4 predefined values (OFF, LOW, MEDIUM, HIGH), now
    gain range -24 dB up to +24 dB is supported writing directly the dB value.
    A value of -255 indicates OFF.

version 1.0.3.0, 2005-04-14

    payload type is not changed. Previously it was always set (also to zero).
CHG On IFXPHONE_RTP_CONF and PHONE_DTMF_OOB if event transmission is not
    selected event payload type zero always returns an error.
NEW Check resource for CPT, return err if not available
NEW Capabilities for signal detection
NEW Chip types are evaluated and stored after firmware download
NEW Added multi task protection around signal detection configuration
FIX Problems of internal data corruption in case of Write Cmd usage
    for Alm and Coder Channel (CR8091)
CHG PCM configuration for IFXPHONE_INIT updated (PCM_PHONE and PCM_DSP)
FIX Remove dependency between PCM configuration and PCM activation.
FIX Store new PCM config and activation status (TAPI) only after successful
    check by LL (Vinetic) function.
CHG Check allocated PCM timeslots during activation and deactivation,
    not during configuration.

version 0.11.4.1, 2005-01-27
----------------------------
FIX for predefined tones: Stopping was not possible
FIX Cid transparent buffer is copied into kernel space now (Linux)
FIX flag for "need wakeup" was sometimes cleared without wakeup
    but application task still waiting in select function

version 0.11.3.1, 2005-01-21
----------------------------
NEW CID2 for Japan implemented
CHG Removed fixed setting of VIN_V14_SUPPORT (only set as default if none of
    VIN_V14_SUPPORT or VIN_V21_SUPPORT was set from makefile)
CHG Cleanup dependencies between compiler switches, allows better reduction
    of driver features (e.g. PCM only for VIN 4S)
NEW Support of VINETIC 4S V2.2
DEL Removed option DC Calibration from VINETIC Init message,
    to have a clean split between chip and channel error domains.
    The DC calibration belongs to the channel error domain while VINETIC
    Init belongs to the chip error domain.
    Applications should use the separate Offset Calibration ioctl to calibrate
    channels after chip initialisation.
FIX Event transmission bug after DTMF CID fixed.
FIX Amplitude modulation workaround for firmware problem of clearing
    status bits. Between each AM signal detection it is required to call
    IFXPHONE_DISABLE_SIGDETECT and IFXPHONE_ENABLE_SIGDETECT
NEW Call progress tone detection implemented based on simple tone API
FIX First verification of simple tone API done
NEW Ground key high validation: On GNDKH the line is switched off and
    switched back after 10 ms. First GNDKH is ignored if no further GNDKHs
    are reported after switching on the line again.
CHG tooling interrupt information is only stored in FIFO if report is switched on

version 0.10.3.2, 2004-12-22
----------------------------
NEW Patch for new Jitter Buffer Configuration.
NEW Patch for new Jitter Buffer Statistics
NEW Patch for CNG spectral noise (PHONE_VAD on sets NS and CNG to 1)
FIX for tone detection: channel 1 and higher was not detecting CED.
    Only the first and third phase reversals will be detected.

version 0.10.3, 2004-12-07
--------------------------
FIX TAPI_Phone_GetStatus

KNOWN PROBLEMS
   - GR909 :
   * Blocking waits are used because of the required time accuracy for settling
     time and sampling. For a multichannel service with voice ongoing, this is
     killing because the packets will not be dropped in time. Also the use of a
     non blocking wait (with sheduler) doesn't garantee that time requirements
     will be meet and introduces measurement inacurracy. This implies a concept
     change for GR909 feature in the future (i.e  Gr909 in Chip and not on
     embedded software side).
   * A concept to recognise if a foreign voltage is pending before doing the
     measurement is required, as the ground key recognition isn't reliable.
     In fact, they are situations where Vinetic doesn't send the ground key event
     although an external (foreign) voltage is pending.

version 0.10.2, 2004-12-03
--------------------------
NEW All GR909 Measurements succesfully evaluated on Vinetic 1.4.
    Time requirement of 2 sec and measurements accuracy of 10% are met.
    Timing:
    - Foreign Voltage (Hazardeous & FEMF)    : 350 ms
    - Resistive Fault                        : 825 ms
    - Receiver Offhook                       : 240 ms
    - Ringer Load                            : 210 ms
    Total: 1625 ms out of 2000 ms (= 2 sec)
NEW CID Type 2 implemented (USA spec TIA/EIA-777).
FIX Implementation for packet read for 8 bit Intel interface corrected
FIX Exception mask was not evaluated in IFXPHONE_STATUS. If digits occured the
    fifo was always read. Now the reading of the fifo can be masked and digits
    can be queried with PHONE_GET_DTMF or PHONE_GET_PULSE.
FIX Pulse digit was not set to any value if fifo is empty. Now it returns -1
    if no digits are in.
FIX Event transmission bug in correlation with DTMF CID fixed.
FIX GR909 Receiver Offhook Resistive Faults tests were inaccurate because of
    missing coefficient table for IK (constant current) for Vinetic 1.4.
FIX GR909 AC Voltage measurements were innacurate because level meter results
    sampling was done without 1 ms time intervall.
CHG GR909 Receiver Offhook measurements are done for 15 mA and 30 mA IK
CHG During GR909 AC voltage measurements, samples are (right) shifted by 2 to
    avoid 32-bit overflow during samples addition. In the final formula, this
    shift is taken in count to remove the shift : left shift by 2. Doing so
    makes it possible to measure voltages until 220 Vrms with the specified
    precision (10 %).
CHG Ground Key Recognition is the trigger of GR909 voltage measurements. Because
    it is possible that no ground key is issued by vinetic although an external
    voltage is pending, the ground key flag is stored after first recognition
    and reseted only after a successfull measurement.

FIX  Capacitance measurement, changed formula to calculate the average current
FIX  Runtime trace for SC_OPMODE were wrong, bit CMD1_OM was missing (only)
     in the trace.

KNOWN PROBLEMS
   - The SNR measurement for the VINETIC 2.1 will only work correctly for
     1004 Hz, lm_filter coefficients for all other frequencies have to be
     replaced when provided...
   - VINETIC 1.4: On fast CPUs the board specific WAIT_FOR_READY_FLAG macro has
     to be adapted to wait t_srd = 125ns before the ready bit is polled after
     each command. See VINETIC-4VIP Prel. Data Sheet DS1, Page 42ff.
   - Vinetic 2.1: Linetesting measurements do not work in Power Down Resistive
     Mode and Sleep Power Down Resistive Mode. A workaround is available, but
     not yet implemented.
   - All TAPI tones for Vinetic 2.1 will not be correct.

version 0.9.15, 2004-10-06
--------------------------
NEW  LT 2.1 configurable integration time for (battery-)voltage, current and
     resistance measurement
NEW  LT 2.1 resistance RC measurement
NEW  CRAM format 2.2 (adds configuration for TSTR2 register)
     Moved setting of CRAM download related registers (BCR1,2, TSTR2)
     to driver level.
     Note: The ioctl distinguishes now between the CRAM download format
     version VINETIC_IO_CRAM_FORMAT_2_1 and VINETIC_IO_CRAM_FORMAT_2_2;
     VINETIC_IO_CRAM_FORMAT_2 was removed.
NEW  Packets interrupts are masked when the driver is configured for polling
CHG  Payload assignment in that way, that PT for SID is 13 for G711
     and G726. For other codecs its the same PT for the SID as for coder data
     (CR200007149)
FIX  LT universal "AC level" measurement does not change the lm_filter type
     setting to enable filter characteristics measurements
FIX  mailbox could become corrupted when a packet overflow occured
FIX  offset calibration for Vin2.1 was left with DC_SLIC + LM_PREGAIN OFR value
     (bug introduced in internal version 0.9.14.2)
FIX  AAL firmware coder channel configuration was wrong
FIX  default AAL profile was configured to decode G.711 A-Law while the coder
     used u-Law. Now the decoder uses u-Law as well.
FIX  decoding of channel number for downstream packets in polling mode;
     channel numbers 16++ were not decoded correctly
FIX  Linux hangs in CmdRead (introduced in internal version 0.9.14.2)
FIX  bug fix in tapi init: in case DS_DEV_INIT is not set, initialization
     ignores this state and continues, what can lead to a software error
     if the firmware wasn't yet downloaded.
FIX  added overflow protection for packet inbox (i.e. free mailbox space is
     checked before data is written) [patched 2004-10-20]

KNOWN PROBLEMS
   - The lm_filter overflows for large levels. This will be fixed with a later
     ARC patch. Until this patch becomes available, the lm_filter is disabled
     for the gaintracking and SNR signal measurement.
   - The current lm_filter coefficients cannot be used for Notch filters which
     are required for SNR measurements. Until proper lm_filter coefficients
     are available, the SNR measurement will not show correct results.
   - Battery voltage measurements are not implemented for VMB3324.
   - VINETIC 1.4: On fast CPUs the board specific WAIT_FOR_READY_FLAG macro has
     to be adapted to wait t_srd = 125ns before the ready bit is polled after
