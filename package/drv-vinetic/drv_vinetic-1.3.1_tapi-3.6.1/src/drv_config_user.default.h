/** \file drv_config_user.h
   This file is intended to customize some optional settings of the driver.

   In case of optional features (like SPI interface) it may also contain
   some required definitions where no default values are making sense.

   This file will only be used if the compiler switch ENABLE_USER_CONFIG
   is defined (e.g. by "configure --enable-user-config")

   \remark
   This file (drv_config_user.default.h) is intended as a template.
   All options are commented in detail, defined with their default values
   (where possible) and disabled with an "#if 0 / #endif" block.

   To use this file, make a copy with the name "drv_config_user.h" in your
   build- or source-directory and enable (#if 1) the options you want to change.
